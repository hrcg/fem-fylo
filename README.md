# Overview

Frontend Mentor Challenge.
Made using HTML/SASS, I was able to mostly 1:1 the design with some exeptions, like the font and the testimonials section.

# Getting Started

To get started, I suggest you take a look at Github's quickstart guide [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), as it goes into the necessary detail to get this project up and running.
